I'm Fengjie Li (you can call me FFengJay as well). This is my personal wiki that I use to organize my notes, ideas and thoughts.


## About Research 

I'm a PostGraduate Student in Computer Science at Tianjin University, China. I'm exploring the program analysis, program repair, program synthesis. Recently, I'm have finished serveral works about combining large language models and program repair. You can find my works in [my google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=btcwJ_EAAAAJ&hl=en), feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

## About Reading

I'm insterested in reading philosophy, history and psychology. I'm reading books about Camus and Hesse and history about Ming dynasty. I'll share my reading notes here in the future.

## About Life

I am in my twenties now, and my life philosophy is "go with the flow". I'm enjoying every moment of my life, I hope you enjoy your life too.

Thanks of your time :)
